# HelpShelf Platform Documentation

Complete technical documentation for HelpShelf's full-stack platform, covering both Django backend services and React/TypeScript frontend architecture for engineering team integration.

## üè¢ Business Context

[HelpShelf.com](https://helpshelf.com) is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that provides AI-powered customer support solutions. The HelpShelf widget, which a customer installs on their website as a JavaScript snippet, connects to API sources and indexes the content for AI-based search. The platform currently features an existing onboarding process integrated within the Django application. However, this legacy onboarding experience has several limitations:

- **Not mobile-friendly**: The current flow doesn't adapt well to mobile devices
- **Known bugs**: Various UX issues and technical debt have accumulated
- **Design opportunities**: The interface needs modernization to match current standards

## üéØ Onboarding Integration Project

The goal of this integration project is to launch a new React-based onboarding UI (`helpshelf-ui`) that:

- **Bypasses the Django layer entirely** for improved performance and flexibility
- **Connects directly to backend services** via existing API endpoints (with minor tweaks as needed)
- **Deploys as either**:
  - Full-screen takeover using an iframe within the existing application
  - New browser tab that opens independently from the main platform
- **Provides a modern, mobile-responsive experience** that addresses all current limitations

## üìã Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for HelpShelf's multi-tenant SaaS platform, including backend APIs, frontend architecture, and integration patterns between the Django backend and React/TypeScript frontend (`helpshelf-ui`).

## üéØ Purpose

**Target Audience**: New full stack engineers onboarding to the HelpShelf platform  
**Primary Use Case**: Understanding backend architecture for helpshelf-ui integration via iframes and direct API calls
